Cinderella                Once upon a time, there lived a girl named Cinderella. She lived with her step mother and two step sisters. The step mother and her two daughters didn't like Cinderella. They treated Cinderella very bad. Cinderella usually did the hardest works in the house; such as scrubbing the floor, cleaning the pot and pan and preparing the food for the family, and so on. Cinderella One day, a ball was to be held by the royal family of the kingdom to find the Prince's spouse. Cinderella wanted to go to the ball but her step mother asked her to stay at home and do the house works. Cinderella cried. Then there was a fairy godmother standing beside her. "Why are you crying, Cinderella?", the fairy godmother asked. "Because I want to go to the ball but my step mother insists me to stay at home. Besides, I don't have any beautiful dress" said Cinderella. Then the fairy turned Cinderella's ugly dress became the most beautiful dress and with beautiful slippers. The fairy also turned a pumpkin into a parking coach and the mice become six white horses. Cinderella finally could go to the ball but she had to come back before midnight before the spell ended. At the ball, Cinderella amazed everybody there include the Prince. The Prince asked her to dance. Cinderella had a wonderful time at the ball. But, all of a sudden, she heard the sound of a clock, the first stroke of midnight. Remembered what the fairy had said, Cinderella ran back to go home. But she lost one of her slippers in ballroom. The Prince picked up her slipper and would search for the girl whose foot fitted with the slipper. A few days later, the Prince proclaimed that he would marry the girl whose feet fitted the slipper. Her step sisters tried on the slipper but it was too small for them, no matter how hard they squeezed their toes into it. In the end, the King's solder let Cinderella try on the slipper. She stuck out her foot and the page slipped the slipper on. It fitted perfectly. Finally, she was driven to the palace. The Prince was overjoyed to see her again. They were married and live happily ever after.soal nya ada di gambar ​</a>

The sugar glider is a possum – very similar to the tupai in Indonesia. It basically lives in trees. It eats leaves and fruit. However, the Australian sugar glider has a very special skill. It can jump from tree to tree like a tupai but it can also `sort of fly’ as well. In fact, it glides or terbang layang in Bahasa Indonesia.

The night of the ball arrived, and the sisters and mother laughed and left. Cinderella cried and wished she could attend also. At that moment her Fairy God Mother appeared and used her magic so that Cinderella could attend, giving her a dress, glass slippers, and turning a pumpkin into a carriage. She also informed Cinderella that this spell will only last to until midnight Cinderella went off onto the ball and while she was there she attracted quite a bit of attention especially from the Prince. The two danced all night, til Cinderella heard the clock chime. She remembered what her god mother said, and dashes off, leaving only a slipper behind.

I wish the following paragraphs would chronicle years of parental neglect or some sort of rare neuromuscular disorder that prevented me from pedalling, but I have no one to blame but myself. It’s not that I haven’t tried. I just can’t.
My childhood progressed like any other. Tricycles, training wheels – no problem. But the two-wheeled version proved troublesome. I would start moving just fine, but then, with the agility of a drunken trapeze artist, I would tilt, panic and put my feet down as the pedals continued rotating and slapped me in back of the legs.
It was no big deal at first. All my friends were learning, too. It’s a rite of passage. But for me this particular rite never quite seemed to pass. And when my brother – three years younger than me – started riding with all the zest of Pee-wee Herman, I realized there was a problem.
My first instinct was to hide my failure so that my friends would never know. I became a damn good rollerblader and I had a believable set of excuses on hand in the event I was ever asked to go mountain biking. I even brainwashed myself into believing in the virtues of not riding a bike. Pumping the tires, greasing the chain, locking it up everywhere you went, it all seemed like a hassle to me. And who looks good in a helmet?
But there would be one quiet Sunday every summer when I would walk my bike over to the schoolyard in secrecy, hop on, tip over and hop off, my scratched calves a strong enough deterrent until next year.
My parents took it hard. Is there a bigger mark of a failed fatherhood than a son who cannot ride a bike? At least I could throw a baseball (horribly). After years of walking alongside me, holding the back of my seat, they took drastic measures. While we were on vacation in Lake Placid, N.Y., they sought out the services of a cycling sage whose job it was to teach people to ride bikes. After three mosquito-bitten hours in the woods, he began to question his career.
Once I entered high school, my Schwinn-less abilities were largely forgotten. High school was all about showing up late, looking bored and shuffling through the halls at an irritatingly casual pace. It was, literally, the anti-bike society. I was proud to be a non-biker, shunning the punctuality, shorts and cardiovascular health that came with it. I had one friend who wanted to be a bike courier. He was largely ostracized.
I did try once more in Grade 10 after confessing my secret to a girl in a last-ditch attempt to embark on a sexual Tour de France. After an hour of calf-scratched mockery and a short trip to second base, I pulled out of the race and never opened my mouth again.
The Lance Armstrong scandal reinforced my reluctance in adulthood: I’d had a bad feeling about him from the beginning. In fact I didn’t push a pedal for the next 10 years.
I may have forgotten, but my mother never did. One hot, unsuspecting July afternoon, she couldn’t take it any more. She grabbed me, gave me her bike and sent me to the schoolyard, telling me not to leave until I’d learned.
After a bit of scrupulous surveillance to make sure no one was in sight, I climbed aboard the beast – a women’s bike that was three sizes too small. I launched into strategic warfare with my childhood and my decade-dormant equilibrium. Should I pedal first? Push and then pedal? Did I still have the training wheels in the garage?
After an hour and a half of scratched calves, internal tantrums and the threat of testicular atrophy from the female crossbar, I finally started to go. Five seconds at first, then I panicked and tipped over, but I turned around and started again. Ten seconds, 20 seconds and then a full minute without kissing pavement. I felt a rush of fresh new air in my lungs, a breath that was a little more complete. I am sure my cries of “Hey! Hey! Look at this!” drew more than a few neighbours to their windows to see an overgrown man’s low-budget re-enactment of E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial.
Did this newfound skill start a renaissance of childlike wonder and being? Absolutely not. In fact, I still absolutely suck. I have difficulty steering, and mastering the brakes might take me another 25 years.
But I did learn one thing: Your successes don’t define you, your failures do. Embrace your failures – they keep you going. If we only had successes we’d have nothing to live for. And if you can’t quite crack the code, put it down, but never walk away, even if it takes you 10 years. It’s just like riding a bike.</a>

Neil Smith: We are establishing a new office in Tokyo, and we are interested in purchasing a large 
amount of goods from your company. Of course, provided that you give us a good offer.
Adam Jackson: What amount approximately are we talking about?
Neil Smith: We would need around 500 tables and twice that of chairs, as well as some other office 
furniture. We will decide on the exact numbers no later than next Thursday.
Adam Jackson: I see. We could definitely offer a discount for such an amount of goods.
Neil Smith: So, how much of a discount would you be willing to offer to us? I know that this is on short 
notice, but I'd like to add that we are on the hunt for a long-time partner.
Adam Jackson: I would like you to consider our offer of 5% off for the upcoming purchase and maybe a 
little bit more after the contract for a longer-term relationship is signed. How does that sound to you?
Neil Smith: (1) I am afraid that might not be enough to close the deal. We are evaluating offers from 
other suppliers, too.
Adam Jackson: You drive a hard bargain! I guess competition is fierce these days. What about a fixed 
rate of 7% discount? That is my last word.
Neil Smith: (2) That sounds reasonable. I think we have a deal. Thank you very much. It is always a 
pleasure doing business with you, Mr. Jackson.

They treated Cinderella very bad. Cinderella usually did the hardest works in the house; such as scrubbing the floor, cleaning the pot and pan and preparing the food for the family, and so on. Cinderella One day, a ball was to be held by the royal family of the kingdom to find the Prince's spouse. Cinderella wanted to go to the ball but her step mother asked her to stay at home and do the house works. Cinderella cried. Then there was a fairy godmother standing beside her. "Why are you crying, Cinderella?", the fairy godmother asked. "Because I want to go to the ball but my step mother insists me to stay at home. Besides, I don't have any beautiful dress" said Cinderella. Then the fairy turned Cinderella's ugly dress became the most beautiful dress and with beautiful slippers. The fairy also turned a pumpkin into a parking coach and the mice become six white horses. Cinderella finally could go to the ball but she had to come back before midnight before the spell ended. At the ball, Cinderella amazed everybody there include the Prince. The Prince asked her to dance. Cinderella had a wonderful time at the ball. But, all of a sudden, she heard the sound of a clock, the first stroke of midnight. Remembered what the fairy had said, Cinderella ran back to go home. But she lost one of her slippers in ballroom. The Prince picked up her slipper and would search for the girl whose foot fitted with the slipper. A few days later, the Prince proclaimed that he would marry the girl whose feet fitted the slipper. Her step sisters tried on the slipper but it was too small for them, no matter how hard they squeezed their toes into it. In the end, the King's solder let Cinderella try on the slipper. She stuck out her foot and the page slipped the slipper on. It fitted perfectly. Finally, she was driven to the palace. The Prince was overjoyed to see her again.

                            11. Read the text to answer questions 1 to 3.The sugar glider is a marsupial, just like the many other Australian animals – the kangaroo, the koala and the wombat for instance. The sugar glider is a possum – very similar to the tupai in Indonesia. It basically lives in trees. It eats leaves and fruit. However, the Australian sugar glider has a very special skill.

Keduanya menari sepanjang malam, sampai Cinderella mendengar jam berbunyi.  Dia ingat apa yang dikatakan ibu baptisnya, dan berlari pergi, hanya menyisakan sandal.

I wish the following paragraphs would chronicle years of parental neglect or some sort of rare neuromuscular disorder that prevented me from pedalling, but I have no one to blame but myself. It’s not that I haven’t tried. I just can’t.
My childhood progressed like any other. Tricycles, training wheels – no problem. But the two-wheeled version proved troublesome. I would start moving just fine, but then, with the agility of a drunken trapeze artist, I would tilt, panic and put my feet down as the pedals continued rotating and slapped me in back of the legs.
It was no big deal at first. All my friends were learning, too. It’s a rite of passage. But for me this particular rite never quite seemed to pass. And when my brother – three years younger than me – started riding with all the zest of Pee-wee Herman, I realized there was a problem.
My first instinct was to hide my failure so that my friends would never know. I became a damn good rollerblader and I had a believable set of excuses on hand in the event I was ever asked to go mountain biking. I even brainwashed myself into believing in the virtues of not riding a bike. Pumping the tires, greasing the chain, locking it up everywhere you went, it all seemed like a hassle to me. And who looks good in a helmet?
But there would be one quiet Sunday every summer when I would walk my bike over to the schoolyard in secrecy, hop on, tip over and hop off, my scratched calves a strong enough deterrent until next year.
My parents took it hard. Is there a bigger mark of a failed fatherhood than a son who cannot ride a bike? At least I could throw a baseball (horribly). After years of walking alongside me, holding the back of my seat, they took drastic measures. While we were on vacation in Lake Placid, N.Y., they sought out the services of a cycling sage whose job it was to teach people to ride bikes. After three mosquito-bitten hours in the woods, he began to question his career.
Once I entered high school, my Schwinn-less abilities were largely forgotten. High school was all about showing up late, looking bored and shuffling through the halls at an irritatingly casual pace. It was, literally, the anti-bike society. I was proud to be a non-biker, shunning the punctuality, shorts and cardiovascular health that came with it. I had one friend who wanted to be a bike courier. He was largely ostracized.
I did try once more in Grade 10 after confessing my secret to a girl in a last-ditch attempt to embark on a sexual Tour de France. After an hour of calf-scratched mockery and a short trip to second base, I pulled out of the race and never opened my mouth again.
The Lance Armstrong scandal reinforced my reluctance in adulthood: I’d had a bad feeling about him from the beginning. In fact I didn’t push a pedal for the next 10 years.
I may have forgotten, but my mother never did. One hot, unsuspecting July afternoon, she couldn’t take it any more. She grabbed me, gave me her bike and sent me to the schoolyard, telling me not to leave until I’d learned.
After a bit of scrupulous surveillance to make sure no one was in sight, I climbed aboard the beast – a women’s bike that was three sizes too small. I launched into strategic warfare with my childhood and my decade-dormant equilibrium. Should I pedal first? Push and then pedal? Did I still have the training wheels in the garage?
After an hour and a half of scratched calves, internal tantrums and the threat of testicular atrophy from the female crossbar, I finally started to go. Five seconds at first, then I panicked and tipped over, but I turned around and started again. Ten seconds, 20 seconds and then a full minute without kissing pavement. I felt a rush of fresh new air in my lungs, a breath that was a little more complete. I am sure my cries of “Hey! Hey! Look at this!” drew more than a few neighbours to their windows to see an overgrown man’s low-budget re-enactment of E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial.
Did this newfound skill start a renaissance of childlike wonder and being? Absolutely not. In fact, I still absolutely suck. I have difficulty steering, and mastering the brakes might take me another 25 years.
But I did learn one thing: Your successes don’t define you, your failures do. Embrace your failures – they keep you going. If we only had successes we’d have nothing to live for. And if you can’t quite crack the code, put it down, but never walk away, even if it takes you 10 years. It’s just like riding a bike.</h2><br />
                        Saya
 berharap paragraf berikut akan babad tahun kelalaian orang tua atau 
semacam gangguan neuromuskuler langka yang mencegah saya mengayuh, tapi 
saya tidak memiliki satu untuk disalahkan kecuali diri sendiri. Bukan karena saya belum mencoba. Aku hanya tidak bisa.<br />Masa kecil saya berkembang seperti yang lain. Becak, roda pelatihan - tidak ada masalah. Tapi versi roda dua terbukti merepotkan. Saya akan mulai bergerak dengan baik, tapi kemudian, dengan kelincahan
 seorang seniman trapeze mabuk, aku akan memiringkan, panik dan 
meletakkan kaki saya turun sebagai pedal terus berputar dan menampar 
saya di belakang kaki.<br />Itu bukan masalah besar pada awalnya. Semua teman-teman saya belajar juga. Ini adalah ritus perjalanan. Tapi bagi saya ritual khusus ini tidak pernah cukup tampaknya untuk lulus. Dan ketika saudara saya - tiga tahun lebih muda dari saya - mulai naik
 dengan semua semangat dari Pee wee Herman-, saya menyadari ada masalah.<br />Insting pertama saya adalah untuk menyembunyikan kegagalan saya sehingga teman-teman saya tidak akan pernah tahu. Saya
 menjadi rollerblader sangat bagus dan saya punya satu set dipercaya 
alasan di tangan di acara saya pernah diminta untuk pergi bersepeda 
gunung. Aku bahkan dicuci otak sendiri menjadi percaya dalam kebajikan tidak naik sepeda. Memompa ban, mengoles rantai, menguncinya di mana-mana Anda pergi, semuanya tampak seperti kerumitan bagi saya. Dan yang terlihat baik di helm?<br />Tapi akan ada satu Minggu tenang setiap musim panas ketika aku akan 
berjalan sepeda saya ke sekolah dalam kerahasiaan, naik, ujung atas dan 
hop off, saya tergores betis pencegah cukup kuat sampai tahun depan.<br />Orang tua saya membawa sulit. Apakah ada tanda lebih besar dari ayah yang gagal daripada anak yang tidak bisa naik sepeda? Setidaknya aku bisa melempar bisbol (mengerikan). Setelah
 bertahun-tahun berjalan bersama saya, memegang bagian belakang tempat 
duduk saya, mereka mengambil langkah-langkah drastis. Sementara
 kami sedang berlibur di Lake Placid, NY, mereka mencari jasa seorang 
bijak bersepeda yang tugasnya adalah untuk mengajarkan orang untuk naik 
sepeda. Setelah tiga jam nyamuk-digigit di hutan, dia mulai mempertanyakan karirnya.<br />Setelah saya masuk SMA, kemampuan Schwinn-kurang saya dilupakan. SMA
 adalah semua tentang muncul terlambat, tampak bosan dan menyeret 
melalui lorong-lorong dengan kecepatan menjengkelkan kasual. Itu, secara harfiah, masyarakat anti-sepeda. Saya bangga menjadi non-biker, menghindari ketepatan waktu, celana pendek dan kesehatan jantung yang datang dengan itu. Aku punya satu teman yang ingin menjadi kurir sepeda. Ia sebagian besar dikucilkan.<br />Aku
 mencoba sekali lagi di kelas 10 setelah mengakui rahasiaku dengan 
seorang gadis dalam upaya terakhir untuk memulai seksual Tour de France.
 Setelah satu jam betis-tergores ejekan dan perjalanan singkat ke base 
kedua, saya menarik diri dari balapan dan tidak pernah membuka mulut 
lagi.<br />Lance Armstrong Skandal diperkuat keengganan saya di masa dewasa: aku punya firasat buruk tentang dia dari awal. Bahkan saya tidak mendorong pedal untuk 10 tahun ke depan.<br />Aku mungkin sudah lupa, tapi ibu saya tidak pernah melakukannya. Satu panas, tidak curiga sore Juli, dia tidak bisa tahan lagi. Dia meraih saya, memberi saya sepedanya dan mengirim saya ke sekolah, mengatakan tidak pergi sampai aku pelajari.<br />Setelah
 sedikit pengawasan yang seksama untuk memastikan tidak ada seorang pun
