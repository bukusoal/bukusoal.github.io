                                            Soal SImak UI Bahasa Inggris ____ To some extent the comparison is apt, and to a degree it is helpful in understanding what an actor does when he is creating and performing a role. With his kings and queens, his cowboys and Indian, or his spacemen, the child projects himself into a make-believe world. From his imagination-triggered by his own experience, limited though it may be-he provides circumstances of time, place, and relationship between the characters. He then proceeds to behave, that is, to speak and to perform physical actions, in a manner that he believes in appropriate to these circumstances. If the game is to prove interesting, these circumstances must provide a reason for carrying out the actions. He has to rescue the princess from the enchanted castle, or rid the town of dangerous bandits, or get his spaceship into orbit without being detected by the enemy. A child with imagination can become involved in such a game to the extent that it has for him a degree of reality, and he may become resentful of adults who intrude into his make-believe world.
 The paragraph following the above most likely discusses ...  
A.	Children’s vast imagination
B.	The privacy of make-believe world of children
C.	Adult’s resentful reaction toward children’s imagination
D.	Examples of games which may be taken as reality by children
E.	How to restrict children’s imagination</a>

                                            Soal SImak UI Bahasa Inggris The unmistakable buzz of a bumblebee is one of the quintessential sounds of British summertime. However, this slender sound and faint utterance is under threat because bumblebees are in crisis. Of the 25 species native to Britain, three have already been declared extinct, five are designated UK Biodiversity Action Plan priority species, and many more have undergone major range contractions. The great yellow bumblebee, Bombus destinguendus, for example, is now restricted to northern Scotland, Orkney and the Hebrides, and the shirll carder bee, Bombus sylvarum, which was once common throughout southern Britain, now exists only in seven small groups. In addition, as these populations become more isolated they can become inbred, which increase the risk of further extinctions.
At the end of summer all the bumblebees in a colony die, apart from the virgin queens who mate and then leaves the nest to hibernate over winter. In the spring a queen will make new nest, lay eggs and then raise the first batch of workers. This annual cycle depends on there being enough pollen and nectar to sustain the queen as she establishes her nest and team of workers as the colony grows. Pollen is a protein rich fuel that is key to helping over wintered queens to kick start their reproductive systems ready and for the development of larvae. Nectar, on the other hand, is asugar rich fuel which is converted to honey to feed adult bees. The bees make honey by adding to the nectar in their honey sacs an enzyme called invertase, which converts sucrose sugars to a mixture of glucose and fructose. Once the workers are develop, they take over the foraging and the queen concentrates on laying eggs. Later in the year, if the colony has been successful and reaches a large enough size, the queen will produce male eggs and some female eggs are raised as new queens.
A lack of resources is thought to be the critical factor that is affecting bumblebee populations, and it is related to the loss of wild flowers, both in the countryside and in vast suburban gardens. The biggest impact has been the availability of food and drink, in particular the continuity of supplies throughout the colony cycle. Although nectar is available from a wide range of plants, the bees can be much more choosy about where they collect pollen from, sometimes restricting this to very few flowering plants. In Scotland, overwintered queens of the declining and beautiful bilberry bumblebee focus on bilberry in spring. Other species may focus on legumes such as red clover and bird’s foot trefoil. Sadly, because the UK has lost 98% of its flower rich grasslands, this has been devastating for some bumblebee species.  Why did the writer mention the queens of bilberry bumblebee?  
A.        To describe how a bumblebee may look like
B.        To give example of bees which can survive the winter
C.        To show one species of bees whose food resource is declining
D.        To give an example of a species of bumblebees which is declining
E.        To give an example of bees which are very selective about source of pollen</a>

                                            tolong bantu jawab bahasa InggrisCristiano RonaldoCristiano Ronaldo has very strong determination. He used to train very hard since his childhood. He knew that a footballer requires good stamina because a football match requires a player to run at least 10 kilometers in a single match. Sometimes, he even trained himself continuously from morning until evening. He also challenged himself by playing along with older players.He becomes so skillful and confident that his opponents cannot figure out how to stop Ronaldo from making a goal. Normal football players will use their single leg of their dominant side body, i.e. players of right-handed or left-handed use their respective legs to score goals but Ronaldo can easily use both of his legs efficiently to make goals. In addition to that, he can use his head to score goals as well.He is also one of the fastest football players in football history. Ronaldo can run very fast, he can run with a speed of 33.6 kilometers per hour. That is why he is also known as a rocket man. This helps Ronaldo to do his famous free-kick. Ronaldo's free-kick speed is approximately 130 kilometers per hour.While jumping, Ronaldo's G-force is five times higher than that of a cheetah. He can jump up to 78 cm in the air; this jumping height is much more compared to any basketball player. All of these have helped him achieve his success. In his young age, he has won many trophies and broken records including winning the prestigious FIFA Ballon d'Or award five times and created a world record by scoring the most goals in international football in September 2021. Currently his net worth is around $500 million and this makes him one of the richest athletes.SoalQ:What do you think are two most important traits that should be owned by great athletes?A:Q: What are two physical descriptions that you use to describe Cristiano Ronaldo?A:Q: Mention two facts about Cristiano Ronaldo that you believe make him a great athlete.A:Q: What are three descriptive words that you use the most when drawing a person?A:Q: How did you start your descriptive paragraph?

                            9. Soal SImak UI Bahasa Inggris ____ To some extent the comparison is apt, and to a degree it is helpful in understanding what an actor does when he is creating and performing a role. With his kings and queens, his cowboys and Indian, or his spacemen, the child projects himself into a make-believe world. From his imagination-triggered by his own experience, limited though it may be-he provides circumstances of time, place, and relationship between the characters. He then proceeds to behave, that is, to speak and to perform physical actions, in a manner that he believes in appropriate to these circumstances. If the game is to prove interesting, these circumstances must provide a reason for carrying out the actions. He has to rescue the princess from the enchanted castle, or rid the town of dangerous bandits, or get his spaceship into orbit without being detected by the enemy. A child with imagination can become involved in such a game to the extent that it has for him a degree of reality, and he may become resentful of adults who intrude into his make-believe world.
 The paragraph following the above most likely discusses ...  
A.	Children’s vast imagination
B.	The privacy of make-believe world of children
C.	Adult’s resentful reaction toward children’s imagination
D.	Examples of games which may be taken as reality by children

                            15. Soal SImak UI Bahasa Inggris The unmistakable buzz of a bumblebee is one of the quintessential sounds of British summertime. However, this slender sound and faint utterance is under threat because bumblebees are in crisis. Of the 25 species native to Britain, three have already been declared extinct, five are designated UK Biodiversity Action Plan priority species, and many more have undergone major range contractions. The great yellow bumblebee, Bombus destinguendus, for example, is now restricted to northern Scotland, Orkney and the Hebrides, and the shirll carder bee, Bombus sylvarum, which was once common throughout southern Britain, now exists only in seven small groups. In addition, as these populations become more isolated they can become inbred, which increase the risk of further extinctions.
At the end of summer all the bumblebees in a colony die, apart from the virgin queens who mate and then leaves the nest to hibernate over winter. In the spring a queen will make new nest, lay eggs and then raise the first batch of workers. This annual cycle depends on there being enough pollen and nectar to sustain the queen as she establishes her nest and team of workers as the colony grows. Pollen is a protein rich fuel that is key to helping over wintered queens to kick start their reproductive systems ready and for the development of larvae. Nectar, on the other hand, is asugar rich fuel which is converted to honey to feed adult bees. The bees make honey by adding to the nectar in their honey sacs an enzyme called invertase, which converts sucrose sugars to a mixture of glucose and fructose. Once the workers are develop, they take over the foraging and the queen concentrates on laying eggs. Later in the year, if the colony has been successful and reaches a large enough size, the queen will produce male eggs and some female eggs are raised as new queens.
A lack of resources is thought to be the critical factor that is affecting bumblebee populations, and it is related to the loss of wild flowers, both in the countryside and in vast suburban gardens. The biggest impact has been the availability of food and drink, in particular the continuity of supplies throughout the colony cycle. Although nectar is available from a wide range of plants, the bees can be much more choosy about where they collect pollen from, sometimes restricting this to very few flowering plants. In Scotland, overwintered queens of the declining and beautiful bilberry bumblebee focus on bilberry in spring. Other species may focus on legumes such as red clover and bird’s foot trefoil. Sadly, because the UK has lost 98% of its flower rich grasslands, this has been devastating for some bumblebee species.  Why did the writer mention the queens of bilberry bumblebee?  
A.        To describe how a bumblebee may look like
B.        To give example of bees which can survive the winter
C.        To show one species of bees whose food resource is declining
D.        To give an example of a species of bumblebees which is declining
E.        To give an example of bees which are very selective about source of pollen</h2><br />

                            19. tolong bantu jawab bahasa InggrisCristiano RonaldoCristiano Ronaldo has very strong determination. He used to train very hard since his childhood. He knew that a footballer requires good stamina because a football match requires a player to run at least 10 kilometers in a single match. Sometimes, he even trained himself continuously from morning until evening. He also challenged himself by playing along with older players.He becomes so skillful and confident that his opponents cannot figure out how to stop Ronaldo from making a goal. Normal football players will use their single leg of their dominant side body, i.e. players of right-handed or left-handed use their respective legs to score goals but Ronaldo can easily use both of his legs efficiently to make goals. In addition to that, he can use his head to score goals as well.He is also one of the fastest football players in football history. Ronaldo can run very fast, he can run with a speed of 33.6 kilometers per hour. That is why he is also known as a rocket man. This helps Ronaldo to do his famous free-kick. Ronaldo's free-kick speed is approximately 130 kilometers per hour.While jumping, Ronaldo's G-force is five times higher than that of a cheetah. He can jump up to 78 cm in the air; this jumping height is much more compared to any basketball player. All of these have helped him achieve his success. In his young age, he has won many trophies and broken records including winning the prestigious FIFA Ballon d'Or award five times and created a world record by scoring the most goals in international football in September 2021. Currently his net worth is around $500 million and this makes him one of the richest athletes.SoalQ:What do you think are two most important traits that should be owned by great athletes?A:Q: What are two physical descriptions that you use to describe Cristiano Ronaldo?A:Q: Mention two facts about Cristiano Ronaldo that you believe make him a great athlete.A:Q: What are three descriptive words that you use the most when drawing a person?A:Q: How did you start your descriptive paragraph?
